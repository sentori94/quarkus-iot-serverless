# quarkus-iot-serverless
A Fully serverless IoT simulation backend built with Quarkus (native mode) and deployed on AWS Lambda, using DynamoDB as the primary datastore and Grafana for real-time monitoring. The project demonstrates a clean, scalable, and cost-efficient architecture designed for cloud-native workloads and event-driven systems.
